# Trace table
## Dry Run
   Used to test an algorithm or program code without the use of a computer

### Trace tables: 
a technique used to test algorithms to make sure that no logical errors occur

- used by programmers to track the values of variables as they change throughout the program (see what the code will do before executing it)
- useful when a program is not producing the desired result (find where errors are in code)

## Column
1. Variable
2. Output
3. Input

### EXAM - Looking for pattern (check Algorithm)
