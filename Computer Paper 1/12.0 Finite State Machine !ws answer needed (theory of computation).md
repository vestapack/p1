# FSM
An abstract machine/device that consists of a fixed set of possible states with a set of allowable inputs that change the state and a set of possible outputs.

#### Uses of FSM
design both computer programs and sequenctial logic circuit

#### With Output (ws answer)
go between one state 
# Symbol 
## [Input {slash[/]} Output] arrow direction

# Mealy machine
   determines its outputs from the present state and from the inputs
### Uses
- A Mealy machine can be used to map an input sequence to an output sequence
	- It is used in language parsing
	- It can be used to translate from one language to another

# Moore machine

# State  Transition Table
Shows the effect on the current state of an FSM of particular inputs and any corresponding output.
