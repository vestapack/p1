# Searching Algorithm (n-> number of items)

# Linear Search (sequential search)
   Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm; it starts at the first element in the list and checks every element until it finds the one it is looking for

Used to find a given element in a list by iterating through each one and comparing it to the condition element.

   - search on unordered list
   - time ineffecient 
   - Time complexity **O(n)**

`For i == 0 To length(list)
	`If list(i) == Finditem Then
	`Return ;
	`End If
`NEXT
`Return -1`
# Binary Search
   Binary search is a good way of searching lists that have been sorted.   At each step it halves the number of items it needs to look at.

`Function BS(list, Item, Max, Min)
	`Mid = DIV \ (Integer divide)`
	`If Item > midpoint Then
		`BS(list, Item, midpoint+1, max)`
`END function`

- Faster than linear
- needs to be sorted
- Time complexity O(log2N)

# Binary search tree
![[Pasted image 20220310004856.png]]
Line => branch
Parents -> Left/Right Child
Every node only have 2 max. children(2 descendants)

## Binary search tree -> deal the sorted drawback and nodes are easily added and remove
- LEFT subtree of node [less] than the node
- RIGHT subtree of node [more]
---------------------
1. check root
2. node
3. leave
