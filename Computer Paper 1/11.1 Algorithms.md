# Algorithms 
#algorithm
   independent from programming language
	   -> take it out and use it in different language

# Abstraction   

the process of reducing problems to their essential features by finding similarities or common aspects about the problem, while ignoring differences.

# Abstraction by Generalisation
- Procedural: broken down using procedures / subroutines;
			top-down design 
- Functional: breaking down into a series of reusable functions

- Data: organising and structuring data/ 
			hiding how data is represented to produce a useful view for programmer

- Problem: reducing a problem by removing unnecessary details 
			until the underlying processing requirements are identified.

# Information Hiding
   
- Definition: process of hiding all details of an object that do not contribute to its essential characteristics.
- Meaning: process of providing a definition or interface of a system or object, whilst keeping the inner workings hidden.

# Decomposition - top-down design

- Breaking down a large task into a series of smaller and manageable subtasks.
- Abstraction used.

# Composition
- Building up a whole system from smaller units.

# Automation

process of creating computer models of real-life situations and putting them into action to solve problems.

1. understand problem
2. create algorithm
3. program code and datat structure
4. execute the code
