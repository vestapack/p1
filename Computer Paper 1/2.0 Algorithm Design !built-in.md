# Algorithm 
- a set of instructions independent of any programming language that calculates a function or solves a problem.

## Sequence [1. 2.]
performing or operating each step consecutively in the order they arise
`Console.WriteLine("This is line 1")
`Console.WriteLine("This is line 2")
`Console.WriteLine("This is line 3")`

## Selection [if, case]
 parts of our algorithms that depend on the outcome of a decision / choosing a step.
 `If x > 0 then
 ``  Console.WriteLine("x is positive")
`End If
`If x = 0 then
``   Console.WriteLine("x equals 0")
`End If
`If x < 0 then
  `` Console.WriteLine("x is negative")
`End If
`
## Iteration/Repetition [For repeat while]
something to be done repeatedly until a condition is met.
`Do
 ``  x = x + 1
`Loop Until x = y
`
## Assignment [x <= 3]
an expression where the left hand side is assigned the value of the right hand side.
`x=15`
