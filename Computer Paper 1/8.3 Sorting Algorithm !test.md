# Sort [No Ordering]
## Both Ascending + Decending order
-> Easy to locate

# Bubble Sort - Iteration
The bubble sort algorithm works through a list, comparing pairs of values and swapping them if necessary; repeated until all items are in order.

- 1-dimensional array
- Time complexity O(n^2) => ineffecient

1. Compare each pair by pair
2. swap if necessary
3. Repeat thought the whole list

# Merge Sort - Iteration + Divide & Conquer
The merge sort algorithm works by **splitting a list into individual elements** and then gradually merging them into larger and larger lists until they are all in one sorted list.

- time complexity O(n log n)
- divide, sort and merge
1. Array recursively divided into two halves until the size of 1
2.    The numbers are then sorted as the merge processes comes into action and then starts merging arrays back till the complete array is merged.
