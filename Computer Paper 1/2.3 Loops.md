# Iteration / Repetition (Loops)
- control statements that allow blocks of code to be repeated
### Definite [For]
-> fixed/ count controlled
### Indefinite [Do While Loop Until]
-> condition controlled

## Endless/ infinite Loop
no terminating condition

# For...Next
- Definite iteration/ 'fixed loop'
	-> number of iterations is predictable
- always has a stepper variable -> variable holds a different value on each iteration

`For count /As Integer/ = 1 To 10 Step 2`  [do the following 10 times]
	{count is a stepper var}                 {Each step +ve forward/ -ve for backward}
`Console.WriteLine("{0}.", count)
`Next ` 

# Loop Until [Stop when TRUE]
#### Repeat Until - repeat until condition is TRUE
- Indefinite iteration
- number of iterations will change at runtime
/>> At least run once, condition is tested at the end <<
`Do` -> execute first, check condition
	`code`
`Loop Until condition` [=TRUE]

# Do While...Loop [Loop when TRUE]
- Indefinite iteration
- Loops when condition = true
- Stopping condition is at the start of the loop
- Only executed if the condition is true {at the beginning}
`Do while condtion = TRUE`
	`codes`
`Loop`
