# Type of files
- Text
- CSV
- Binary

# Text
   - a sequence of string [printable] characters that is readible by human
   -  End of each line has a termination marker 
	   - a semi-colon (;) or 
	   - a carriage return (<-').
# CSV Comma-Seperate Value
>separated by a tab -> .tsv
- stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form.
- separated by a comma; (delimiter).
	- popular for mail-merge.

# Binary (.bin)
- stored in binary format.

- a binary file is ‘computer-readable’ but not ‘human-readable’.

 - All executable programs are stored in binary files
	 - (most numeric data files.)

# Import System.IO (library)
# StreamReader
- To read up ad text file, create a "StreamReader"
	- It reads streams of text
	- avaliable in System.IO
### Method 1:
Dim *path* As String = "C:/location path"   
Dim sr As StreamReader = New StreamReader(path)
sr.Close()
### Method 2:
Using re As StreamReader = New StreamReader("file.txt")
End Using
### Read All Text
Dim txt As String = File.ReadAllText(path)
Dim end As String = sr.ReadToEnd()
### Check if Exist
If File.Exist = TRUE then
### Check if FInished
While (NOT sr.EndOfStream)
	sr.Readline()
END While
# StreamWriter
StreamWriter is used to write a stream of text to a file

`Dim path As String = "C:/q.txt"  
`Dim sw As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(path)
	`sw.WriteLine()`
`sw.Close`
### Append
   File.AppendAllText(path, strText)
      WriteAllText() - For New Document

# BinaryReader & BinaryWriter
Dim fs As FileStream = New FileStream(path, FileMode.CreateNew)
### If Exist
Dim fs As FileStream = New FileStream(path, FileMode.Create)
Dim bw As BinaryWriter = New BinaryWriter(fs)
bw.write()

## Binary Reader
Dim fs1 As FileStream = New FileStream(path, FileMode.Open)
Dim br As BinaryReader = New BinaryReader(fs1)

#### Format needed
initial = br.ReadString()
sur = br.ReadString()
age = br.ReadInt32()
## Closing
br.Close()
fs.Close()
