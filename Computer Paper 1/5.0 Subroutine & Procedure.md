# Subroutine => Procedure/ Functions
a named ‘out of line’ block of code that may be executed (called) by simply writing its name in a program statement. 6
### Note:
Modularisation is a technique to split your code into separate parts; these parts are called modules.

#### Adv:
- Re-use code: create a common routine once and re-use as many times as you want
- Structure your programming/code
- Share code with other programs, i.e. easily incorporate other peoples code
- Test subroutines/functions independently of the rest of the code
- Reduces need for global variables as local variables used instead

# Passing parameter
   Parameters in parentheses are used to pass data to a subroutine

-----------------------------
- The order of the parameters in parentheses is important
	- Parameter - Subroutine define
	- Argument - Subroutine call
~+ Argument location: `Call Name(argument)`
~+ With or Without parameters - `Private/Public Function Name(parameters)`

# Procedure
   a sequence of commands or programming code
	   which does not have to return a value.
`Main()`
# Function
   a subroutine that returns one or more values
`var = Main()`
