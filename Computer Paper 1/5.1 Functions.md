# Function
   
a sequence of commands or programming code that returns a value (sends a result back).

***Return***
to return a value from a function, you can either assign the value to the function name or include the function name in a Return statement.

#### VB.NET:
-    Functions return values, Procedures does not have to return a value

# Why using Subroutine

–structure your code

–create a common routine once and re-use as many times as you want

–share code with other programs

–test subroutines/functions independently of the rest of the code

# ByVal vs. ByRef
- Variables can be passed to a subroutine "by reference" or "by value", which are specified with the ByRef or ByVal keyword, respectively. 

- The default in VB.NET is "by value". 
--------
-    by value: a copy of the variable is passed; [define/assign/ user input]
-    by reference: only the memory addresses of the variables are passed[required operation]

User input -> not updated real-time
`a <= userinput(5)`
`ByVal a` = 5
`ByRef a` = 0
`sum = a + 0`
`ByRef sum` = 5
# Code
`   VariableName = FunctionName(argument list)`
	`Sum = Add(Num1, Num2)

`Return variable or formulae`
`Return x
`Return x+y`
### Without parameters
`Sub Main()`
	`result = Sum()`
`End Sub`
`Function Sum()`
	`x = 10`
	`y = 20`
``	Sum = x+y`` [ Assign a formula to the function name, instead of using the return statement (return sum and new variable to add the numbers within the function )]
`End function
#### With parameters
`Return variable`
